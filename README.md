# [Béticos del Universo](http://www.beticosdeluniverso.org) 
Beticos del Universo is a 100% client side website which set "béticos" pictures into a map, allowing to look for places, cities and countries. Created and maintained by [Pepe Valle Mazuelos](https://github.com/ppot14) 

Although the website has been done for fun I've decided to share all the code to everybody, so the code contains other none useful parts for other projects like, socialnetworks buttons, advertise, analytics...

### Frameworks and resources used

* Google Analytics
* Boostrap
* jQuery
* LightBox 2
* Confortaa Font
